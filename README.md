> **Your colony's AI advisor — powered by cutting-edge language models**

RimMind transforms your RimWorld experience by integrating AI intelligence directly into your colony. Through OpenRouter, your in-game AI companion has **46 specialized tools** to query every aspect of your colony — from colonist stats and mood, to resource stockpiles, research progress, base defense, and beyond.

Unlike simple chatbots, RimMind **actually knows** your colony. It can analyze threats, suggest optimal research paths, identify resource bottlenecks, and help you make strategic decisions based on real-time data. It's like having an expert advisor who sees everything happening in your base.
