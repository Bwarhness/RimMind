[h1]🤖 RimMind: Your Colony Just Got a Brain[/h1]

[b]What if your colony could think?[/b]

Imagine having a tactical advisor who never sleeps. Someone who can instantly tell you why your colonists are miserable, which prisoner has the skills to turn your defense from "good enough" to unstoppable, or how to squeeze another three days out of your dwindling food supply before everyone starves.

[b]That's RimMind.[/b] An AI that lives inside your game, sees everything you see, and knows things you don't.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]⚡ This Isn't a Calculator. It's an Oracle.[/h1]

Stop alt-tabbing to wikis. Stop squinting at stat screens. Stop wondering if you're about to make a catastrophic mistake.

RimMind plugs [b]cutting-edge AI[/b] (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini) directly into RimWorld and gives it [b]49 specialized tools[/b] to read, analyze, and [i]manipulate[/i] your colony. It doesn't just answer questions—it [b]solves problems[/b].

[quote]
[b]"Should I accept this quest?"[/b]
[i]*RimMind analyzes the threat, your combat readiness, travel time, and potential rewards in 2 seconds*[/i]
"You have a 73% chance of success. Your best fighter is recovering from malaria—wait 2 days. But if you go now, bring Brick for tanking and Maya for ranged DPS. Her sniper rifle has 98% durability."
[/quote]

Yeah. [i]That[/i] kind of advisor.

[h1]🎯 What Makes RimMind Terrifying (In a Good Way)[/h1]

[h2]🧠 It Sees EVERYTHING[/h2]

Your colonists? RimMind knows their skills, traits, backstories, relationships, health, mood, and the exact moment they're about to snap.

Your resources? It tracks every meal, every medicine, every steel plate across all your stockpiles. Ask "How much steel do I have?" Get an answer. Ask "How much steel do I need to build a hospital?" Get a [i]plan[/i].

Your threats? Raiders incoming? RimMind analyzes their weapons, armor, and tactics while you're still scrambling to draft colonists.

[h2]⚔️ It Plans Like a Strategist[/h2]

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "My defenses suck."
[b]RimMind:[/b] [i]*scans your base layout, turret coverage, and wall integrity*[/i] "Your south wall has no turret coverage and your sandbags are positioned 2 tiles too far forward. Raiders will flank through the western gap. I recommend: move sandbags back, add an autocannon at (47,12), and replace that wooden door with plasteel. Want me to blueprint it?"
[/quote]

You just got a custom defense audit in 3 seconds.

[h2]🏗️ It Builds. Like, Actually Builds.[/h2]

Need a 6x6 granite bedroom at coordinates 45,30? [b]Done.[/b] Walls, door, material, perfect dimensions.

Want a freezer complex with shared walls? [b]Placed.[/b] RimMind handles adjacent construction so you don't waste materials.

Furniture? Workbenches? Defensive walls? Up to [b]100 blueprints in one command[/b]. And they're auto-forbidden until you approve them, so the AI can't accidentally delete your killbox.

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "Build a hospital."
[b]RimMind:[/b] "What size? Where? What material?"
[b]You:[/b] "8x10, near my base, use granite."
[b]RimMind:[/b] [i]*places blueprints*[/i] "Hospital room placed at (52,18). 8x10 interior granite construction with autodoor facing east. Ready for beds and medical equipment. Approve when ready."
[/quote]

You just saved 15 minutes of fiddly blueprint placement.

[h2]🗺️ It "Sees" Your Base With ASCII Vision[/h2]

RimMind doesn't just read stats—it can generate an [b]ASCII map of your entire colony[/b]. Walls, doors, furniture, colonists, threats. It looks at your base layout like a general studying a battle map.

You: "Show me my base."
RimMind: [i]*generates 50x50 grid*[/i] "Here's your colony. Your prison is isolated (good). Your food storage is adjacent to your furnace (bad—fire risk). Your killbox has excellent crossfire but zero retreat coverage."

Instant tactical overview.

[h2]🎭 It Remembers Your Playstyle[/h2]

The [b]Directives System[/b] lets RimMind learn [i]your[/i] colony. Pacifist run? Cannibal raiders? Bionic supremacy? Tell it once, and it remembers forever.

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "I never use wooden walls. Too flammable."
[b]RimMind:[/b] "Noted. I've added a directive: [b]'Prefer stone construction for fire safety.'[/b] I'll recommend granite, limestone, or slate going forward."
[/quote]

Your AI advisor just learned your philosophy.

[h1]💬 Real Conversations, Real Results[/h1]

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "Why is everyone sad?"
[b]RimMind:[/b] [i]*analyzes mood, needs, relationships*[/i] "Three colonists are recreation-starved. Your chess table is in a cramped 3x3 room with -15 beauty. Build a proper rec room (8x8 minimum), add a poker table and horseshoes, and install a sculpture. Also, Brick and Maya just had a social fight—keep them on different work schedules for a few days."
[/quote]

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "Which prisoner should I recruit?"
[b]RimMind:[/b] [i]*scans skills, traits, health*[/i] "The tribal with 18 melee and Brawler trait is a monster in close combat. The pirate with Pyromaniac? Hard pass unless you enjoy fires. The third one has Industrious + 12 crafting—recruit her and your production speed jumps 20%."
[/quote]

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "I need a defense plan."
[b]RimMind:[/b] [i]*generates killbox blueprint*[/i] "Placing a 15x10 killbox at your north entrance. Granite walls, 4 autocannons, sandbag cover, retreat corridor. Estimated cost: 800 steel, 400 components. Build time: 3 days with 4 builders. Approve?"
[/quote]

[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "What should I research next?"
[b]RimMind:[/b] "You're 2 days from Geothermal Power. That gives you 3600W unlimited electricity and frees up your chemfuel for mortar shells. After that, go Fabrication—your legendary crafter can start pumping out masterwork charge rifles."
[/quote]

This is what happens when AI actually [i]understands[/i] RimWorld.
