[h1]🤖 RimMind: Your Colony Just Got a Brain[/h1]

[b]What if your colony could think?[/b]

Imagine a tactical advisor who never sleeps—instantly telling you why colonists are miserable, which prisoner could make your defense unstoppable, or how to survive three more days on dwindling food.

[b]That's RimMind.[/b] An AI that lives inside your game, sees everything you see, and knows things you don't.

[h1]🧠 This Isn't a Calculator. It's an Oracle.[/h1]

Stop alt-tabbing to wikis. Stop squinting at stat screens. RimMind plugs [b]cutting-edge AI[/b] (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini) directly into RimWorld with [b]51 specialized tools[/b] to analyze and manipulate your colony.

[b]"Should I accept this quest?"[/b]
"You have a 73% chance of success. Your best fighter is recovering from malaria—wait 2 days. But if you go now, bring Brick for tanking and Maya for ranged DPS."
[/quote]

[i]That[/i] kind of advisor.

[h1]⚡ What Makes RimMind Terrifying (In a Good Way)[/h1]

[h2]👁️ It Sees EVERYTHING[/h2]
Colonist skills, traits, moods, the exact moment someone's about to snap. Every resource across all stockpiles. Raider weapons and tactics while you're still drafting colonists.

[h2]🎯 It Plans Like a Strategist[/h2]
[quote]
[b]"My defenses suck."[/b]
"Your south wall has no turret coverage. Sandbags are 2 tiles too forward. Raiders will flank west. Move sandbags back, add an autocannon at (47,12), replace that wooden door with plasteel. Want me to blueprint it?"
[/quote]

Custom defense audit in 3 seconds.

[h2]🏗️ It Actually Builds[/h2]
Need a 6x6 granite bedroom? [b]Done.[/b] Freezer with shared walls? [b]Placed.[/b] Up to [b]100 blueprints[/b] in one command—auto-forbidden until you approve.

[quote]
[b]"Build a hospital, 8x10, granite."[/b]
"Hospital placed at (52,18). Granite construction, autodoor facing east. Approve when ready."
[/quote]

[h2]🗺️ ASCII Map Vision[/h2]
RimMind generates [b]ASCII maps of your entire colony[/b]—walls, doors, threats. Like a general studying a battlefield.

[h2]📋 It Manages Your Colonists[/h2]
Set work priorities, schedules, and area restrictions. Copy one colonist's schedule to another. Search the entire map for steel, enemies, or ore deposits instantly.

[h2]💡 It Remembers Your Style[/h2]
The [b]Directives System[/b] learns your preferences. Hate wooden walls? Tell it once. It remembers forever.
