[quote]
[b]You:[/b] "Who should I recruit from these prisoners?"

[h1]🐛 Troubleshooting[/h1]

[h3]"API Error" Messages[/h3]
[list]
[*]Verify your API key is correct in Mod Settings → RimMind
[*]Check your OpenRouter account has credits/payment method
[*]Ensure internet connection is active
[/list]

[h3]Chat Window Not Opening[/h3]
[list]
[*]Check Harmony is installed and loaded before RimMind
[*]Look for errors in RimWorld's debug log (Dev Mode → "~" key)
[/list]

[h3]AI Responses Are Slow[/h3]
[list]
[*]Larger models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) take longer but give better results
[*]Try a faster model like Gemini Flash or Claude Haiku
[*]Complex tool calls (map visualization, building placement) require more processing
[/list]

[h3]Blueprints Won't Build[/h3]
[list]
[*]AI-placed blueprints are [b]forbidden by default[/b] for safety
[*]Use the [b]approve_buildings[/b] tool or manually unforbid them
[*]Or use [b]auto_approve: true[/b] parameter when placing buildings
[/list]
